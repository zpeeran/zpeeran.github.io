      <p class="intro-paragraph" id="intro">
        In recent years, there has been increasing acknowledgement of the impact
        mental health and wellbeing has on students and individuals' success in
        school. It is no secret that mental health conversations were considered
        hush and were not given the appropriate amount of attention in the past.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        21% of U.S adults experienced mental illness in 2020. This represents 1
        in 5 adults. 16.5% of U.S youth ages 6-17 experienced a mental health
        disorder. These are just a few statistics that illustrate the how common
        mental health issues are among our population.

      <h2 class="title">Problem Statement</h2>

      <p class="body">
        There are plenty of mental health resources available for University
        students to take advantage of. The University of Minnesota - Twin Cities
        does a great job in advertising and making sure that students are aware
        of these resources at any time they see fit, but there are some flaws.
        The main problem being that students find <span

          >taking advantage of these resources difficult.</span
        > In this study, I set out to develop a solution that bridges the gap between
        the resources available and the students in need. Positive mental health
        and wellbeing is critical to a student's success in higher education. Developing
        a solution that aids individuals that are struggling would improve the student
        experience.

      <h2 class="title">Research</h2>

      <p class="body">
        I sent out a survey to students at the University of Minnesota - Twin
        Cities in an effort to gain a more accurate understanding of how
        students feel about the resources available to them. Of the 20
        respondents, 75% of students stated that they experienced an increased
        level of stress and anxiety when their course load was increased. Only
        20% of students stated they sought the resources available to them from
        the University. <span class="notation" data-notation-type="highlight-2">
          65% of students stated that they have stayed up all night at least
          twice a week in order to complete assignments.
        </span> 25% of students stated that they felt embarrassed seeking out these
        resources. These metrics were the most important to keep in mind when developing
        a solution for students struggling with mental health

      <p class="body">
        Taking into consideration the results of the survey, I set a few goals
        for myself that I wanted to include in a solution to the problem. I
        wanted to put an emphasis on how important maintaining mental health was
        by implementing a daily check up and incentivizing daily activities that
        have proven to improve the mental wellbeing of individuals. Creating a
        direct and instant point of contact for students to get in touch with
        their professors, instructors, and mental health professionals in case
        of an emergency was a feature that would decrease the feeling of
        embarassment in students seeking extensions or help due to mental health
        complications.

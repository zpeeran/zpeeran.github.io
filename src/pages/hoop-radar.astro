After the survey and the findings were consolidated, we focused on a competitive analysis to pinpoint what features the we wanted to include, considering the competition in our field.Displayed below are some of the important statistics and takeaways that we kept in mind before moving forward with our project.

        title="Ideation"
        body="In our ideation phase we applied our research findings to define our target user. With the help of a few ideation tools that included a Lotus Map, competitive analysis, and the creation of low fidelity prototypes we were finally ready to begin our user testing phase. The problem we were out to solve with this project is that basketball fans have too many options when it comes to consuming content. Our goal is to develop a solution that brings all the benefits of those options into one place for basketball fans of all levels"

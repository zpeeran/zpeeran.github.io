        We developed and sent out a survey that would help us pinpoint some of
        the issues that Valorant players were experiencing regularly, in an
        effort to create a more enjoyable environment for gamers. The findings
        from the survey showed us that the overall experience of Valorant can be
        defined in a coin flip. The experience you have is all dependent on the
        teammates you come across in games. Teammates can either be pleasant and
        helpful, or the opposite end of the spectrum and turn out to be toxic
        and detrimental to the user experience. In this study, we would like to
        explore and provide some recommendations that could alleviate the
        toxicity issue that is rampant in Valorant and create a more enjoyable
        experience for all gamers.

      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        Toxicity in gaming has been around since many of us have begun our
        journeys in games. It is an accurate assumption to say that almost all
        players have been exposed to some sort of toxicity in their game of
        choice. Throughout our playtime and experience with Valorant and other
        FPS titles, sexual harassment/gender and race/ethnicity based language
        are among the most common insults being said in matches. In a study
        conducted by the Anti-Defamation League, findings showed “over 80% of
        multiplayer gamers recently experienced some form of toxicity” and that
        “with over a tenth saying it resulted in depressive or suicidal thoughts
        and over 20% said it caused them to quit playing” <a

          (ADL)</a
        >. These statistics aren’t only for males, but for women as well, who
        are significantly more likely targets of toxicity and verbal abuse. “In
        addition to the psychological harm, studies suggest that such toxicity
        decreases women’s motivation to play video games in the future as well
        as to pursue technical career fields” (ADL). In addition to these
        findings, the results from our own survey showed that toxicity was a
        huge pain point of the player experience in Valorant. We ideated a few
        solutions that we believe would help the issue, as well as some other
        additions to the product that we believe would create a better Valorant
        experience.

      <h2 class="title">Feedback System</h2>

      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        Based on the results of our survey, toxic teammates are the most
        significant pain point in the player experience in Valorant. Punishing
        toxic teammates more than a ban or suspension was one of the most common
        comments we received in our survey. It's not possible to completely
        eliminate toxicity from any game, but we can develop a solution that
        encourages players to be respectful. Taking from Blizzard’s title
        Overwatch, they have a feedback system that is displayed with a badge
        that is visible to all players. After each match, the teammates have the
        ability to commend you for three different qualities; shot caller, good
        teammate, and sportsmanship. As you commend more and more players, your
        feedback level is increased and you are then matched up with players
        with similar badge levels and behavior history as you, based on teammate
        feedback. Implementing a system similar to this in Valorant to rate
        teammates after each match would help alleviate the “coin flip” of
        teammates in each ranked game. These commendations could be categorized
        as; communicative, sportsmanship, and cooperative. As it currently
        stands, the likelihood of getting a teammate with similar behavior as
        you is not very high. This system would increase that likelihood and
        also punish toxic teammates by placing them in lobbies and matches with
        players who have a similar behavior history as them.

      <h2 class="title">Account Verification</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        One of the other pain points that stood out to us from the survey, was
        that Valorant users generally have negative experiences when it comes to
        smurfs. Smurfs are defined as users who create new accounts to play in
        lower ranks, for whatever reason they may have. This creates a fault in
        the competitive integrity of the game because you are matched against
        someone who is significantly above your current skill level. This is a
        large problem with many free-to-play titles because it is so easy to
        just create a new account without having to pay.
        <br />
        <br />One solution that has worked well for Counter-Strike: Global
        Offensive was creating prime accounts. Before CS:GO moved to a
        free-to-play model, the game was $15, and when the transition happened,
        the accounts that had paid previously were defined as “prime accounts”.
        You could also make your account prime by linking a phone number to
        verify it so that only one number was associated with each account.
        Prime accounts got a special matchmaking option to only play against
        other prime accounts. Implementing a way to verify accounts in Valorant
        would significantly decrease the number of smurfs in the lower ranks and
        create a better experience for players who are looking to improve.
        <br />
        <br />For our visual solution, we created two variants that indicate a
        verified account. The first option is a traditional verified checkmark,
        which is synonymous with other platforms and easily identifiable. The
        second option is taking the blank space on the player card and changing
        the color to a glowing green to symbolize verification. This second
        option is consistent with the theme of Valorant and its vibrancy as well
        as the character of gamers.

      <h2 class="title">Agent Select</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        Agents are an integral part of Valorant, they are what separate the game
        from other FPS’s in the category. The current model of selecting an
        agent needs some work. Our survey respondents detailed that
        “instalockers” and not having a fair chance to select an agent of their
        choosing because of factors out of their control creates a negative
        experience for them. Players that have more advanced hardware and in
        turn are loading in faster and immediately locking an agent creates a
        toxic environment for the other players on the team as it can lead to an
        unfavorable composition. This also causes some toxic individuals to
        become petty and start participating in behavior that is detrimental to
        the team and the game. We also observed from our respondents that it
        feels as if they are being forced to play an agent they aren’t confident
        with because they loaded into the lobby last.
        <br />
        <br />Our solution is to implement a waiting period prior to selecting
        agents. This would ideally be per team, and as each of your teammates
        load in, the player icons will fill, and once everyone has loaded in a
        countdown will begin to select agents. Allowing players with less
        powerful computers and slower internet speeds to connect while given
        equal opportunity to select any agent would help alleviate the
        instalocking issue in Valorant, as well as granting an added discussion
        period before selecting.

      <h2 class="title">Quality of Life</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        In our survey, one of the questions asked to respondents was “During a
        Valorant session, what features do you use the most? Are there any
        features that you feel are missing?”. In addition to addressing the main
        pain points, we wanted to attempt to develop some quality of life (QOL)
        changes that would create a better experience for Valorant players. The
        top three responses were a way to spectate friends natively, theater
        mode, and more detailed post-match statistics. While developing these
        are outside the scope of our study, we thought it would be worthwhile to
        address them
        <br />
        <br />OSpectating and watching your friends play a match brings so much
        excitement to everyone involved. We are currently in the age of screen
        sharing in a Discord server for others to watch, but what if there was a
        way to join your friend’s lobby while they were in a game and be able to
        watch their match from their perspective?
        <br />
        <br />Theater mode has been on the wish list of Valorant users since the
        game's inception. Having the option to go back and watch round replays
        to see where you made mistakes and had big highlight moments is
        something that a large percentage of the player base has been wanting
        for a long time. A feature like this would apply to players of all
        levels; competitive players, casuals, and new users
        <br />
        <br />Detailed match statistics would be a well-received feature for
        individuals who are looking to improve competitively and fix micro
        mistakes. Tracker.gg is an extremely popular site that logs various
        statistics that aren’t currently visible to the user natively in
        Valorant. Bringing some of these statistics to the post-match report or
        including them in a separate section when looking at a user's career
        would be a possible solution. This would allow players to have an
        updated, in-depth analysis of their statistics quickly, without leaving
        the Valorant client.
